# typoGlitch

Project description
Small piece of software to create animated glitchy typefaces. The letters get divided in a grid of tiles. Using the GUI the user can set different parameters: font size, number of rows and columns for the tiling, spacing between the tiles. In the input field it’s possible to write the text to be displayed and distorted. Right now the software can be used only one letter at a time, but it's going to be updated soon to allow the users to write full words.


To Nuno
I'm sorry but I didn't manage to get to work the improvements that I was meant to. I'm having some issues with the creation of new classes in Visual Studio. I'm having the same problem that I had in class with the particle exercise. The guided class creator of Vs doesn't put the class in the src folder and I can't manage to connect it to other files. If I manually create the class in the src folder it breaks the build and corrupts the project folder and I lose all the code. These accidents were a huge loss of time and unfortunately I didn't get the final version to work in time for friday, I'm sorry. I’ll try to fix this problem and finish the project as soon as possible, I’ll send you the updated documentation video, hopefully in time for the course collective showreel.
